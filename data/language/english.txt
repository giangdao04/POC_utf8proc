Hence it is that is almost a definition of a gentleman to say he is one who never inflicts pain. 
This description is both refined and, as far as it goes, accurate. 
He is mainly occupied in merely removing the obstacles which hinder the free and unembarrassed action of those about him; 
and he concurs with their movements rather than takes the initiative himself. 
His benefits may be considered a parallel to what are called comforts or conveniences in arrangements of a personal nature, 
like an easy chair or a good fire, which do their part in dispelling cold and fatigue, 
though nature provides both means of rest and animal heat without them. - J.E. Newman.
This is a paragraph from Cardinal Newman’s famous description of a Gentleman in this The idea of a University.
Notice that the paragraph is confined to one point in the character of a gentleman, which is clearly stated in the first, 
or topical sentence viz., that he is one who never inflicts pain.
The rest of the paragraph is simply a development and illustration of the topical sentence. 
And the concluding sentence drives home the statement of the subject with its similies of the easy chair and the good fire.
The Road is one of the great fundamental institutions of mankind. 
Not only is the Road one of the great human institutions because it is fundamental to social existence, 
but also because its varied effects appear in every department of the State. 
It is the Road which determines the sites of many cities and the growth and nourishment of all. 
It is the Road which controls the development of strategies and fixes the sites of battles. 
It is the Road that gives its framework to all economic development. 
It is the Road which is the channel of all trade, and, what is more important, of al ideas. 
In its most humble function it is a necessary guide without which progress from place to place would be a ceaseless experiment; 
it is a sustenance without which organized society would be impossible, thus the Road moves and controls all history. – Hilaire Belloc.
In this paragraph, the first sentence states the subject. 
It is the topical sentence. 
The body of the paragraph consists of examples which prove the statement in the first sentence. 
The final sentence sums up the whole.
Poetry is the language of the imagination and the passions. 
It relates to whatever gives immediate pleasure or pain to the human mind. 
It comes home to the bosoms and businesses of men; 
for nothing but what comes home to them in the most general and intelligible shape can be a subject for poetry. 
Poetry is the universal language which the heart holds with nature and itself. 
He who has a contempt for poetry cannot have much respect for himself, or for anything else. 
Wherever there is a sense of beauty, or power, or harmony, as in the motion of a wave of the sea, in the growth of a flower, there is poetry in its birth.
Here again, the first sentence is the topical sentence. 
The sentences that follow enforce or restate the statement that “poetry is the language of the imagination and the passions", 
and the concluding sentence reinforces it by showing that poetry exists wherever men feel a sense of beauty, power or harmony.
In all these paragraphs, the principles of Unity and Order are observed,
and also the general rules about the place of the topical sentences and the rounding off the whole with a good conclusion.
